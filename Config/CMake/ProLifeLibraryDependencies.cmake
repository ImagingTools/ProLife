# Clean, target-based inter-library dependency graph for ProLife.
#
# This mirrors the approach introduced for the ACF foundation (Acf) in
# Config/CMake/AcfLibraryDependencies.cmake, for AcfSln in
# Config/CMake/AcfSlnLibraryDependencies.cmake, for IAcf in
# Config/CMake/IAcfLibraryDependencies.cmake, for ImtCore in
# Config/CMake/ImtCoreLibraryDependencies.cmake and for IotPlatform in
# Config/CMake/IotPlatformLibraryDependencies.cmake: instead of relying on the
# final executable/package link to resolve symbols and on a hand-tuned build
# order (the add_dependencies()/inline target_link_libraries() spread across the
# per-library CMake files), the dependencies between the ProLife libraries - and
# their dependencies onto the underlying ImtCore::, Acf::, AcfSln:: and IAcf::
# libraries - are declared here as target usage requirements. Include paths and
# link order then propagate transitively and automatically for the in-tree build.
#
# Every ImtCore::/Acf::/AcfSln:: imported target exposes its whole source include
# tree (acf_register_library() adds INCLUDE_DIR/IMPL_DIR as PUBLIC include
# directories), so a single ImtCore:: dependency transitively provides the full
# ImtCore, Acf, AcfSln and IAcf header search paths to the consuming library.
#
# The target_link_libraries() signature is controlled by ACF_LIBRARY_LINK_SCOPE:
#  * when empty, the plain signature is used (matching the legacy ProLife CMake),
#  * when set to PUBLIC/PRIVATE/INTERFACE, the keyword signature is used.
# CMake forbids mixing the plain and keyword signatures on the same target. For
# static libraries the dependency still propagates transitively to consumers.
#
# Dependencies are declared *minimally*: each library lists only its direct
# dependencies; transitive dependencies propagate automatically through the graph.
# Do not add a dependency that is already reachable through another listed target.
#
# Included once, centrally, from Build/CMake/CMakeLists.txt after all library
# targets have been created.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Declare the dependencies of a ProLife library, ignoring any entry whose target
# does not exist in the current configuration (for example feature-gated
# libraries, or ImtCore::/Acf::/AcfSln::/IAcf:: targets that are not available
# because the legacy shim is used instead of find_package).
